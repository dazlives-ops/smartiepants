<h5>About</h5>
<p>Embedded into our long daycare program, we operate a government subsidised Kindergarten program delivered by a Bachelor trained early childhood teacher and supported by two early childhood educators.</p>

<h5>Our Philosophy</h5>
<p>We, as teachers and educators in the Little Geniuses room, acknowledge that Kindergarten is an extremely important stage in each child's life. We acknowledge that each child is unique in personality, their stage of development, culture, customs, values and abilities. Each child's individuality is embraced within the learning environment and is promoted in a number of different ways, with educators and children working side by side to continue to promote each child's attributes. The children receive so many opportunities to grow and develop throughout their many interactions with their peers, engagements with a wide range of experiences and by creating play scenarios in both our indoor and outdoor environments. Our educators strive to plan for the many different interests displayed by the children and acknowledge that these interests help to modify, add to and change our engaging and inviting learning environment. Nutrition and healthy eating is highly valued within our learning environment. Each meal is prepared fresh onsite and each child's dietary requirements and needs are taken into account. We use cooking regularly in our programs to help children gain independence as well as learning science, mathematics and nutrition. Many of our children created meals originate from other countries around the world, which then allows our educators to further teach the children about various cultural beliefs, values, customs and ways of living. </p>

<p>Mathematical concepts are addressed by measuring and counting ingredients; children engage in scientific processes as they observe and experiment with scientific outcomes such as liquids becoming solids; literacy as they engage in instructional text to follow recipes; and, problem-solving and sharing as they work together to create their meals. Clearly labelled water bottles are readily made available to children every day so that they remain hydrated for their busy kinder day.</p>

<p>All of our educators work to instil our many sustainable values and beliefs in the children. Our sustainability garden is filled with a wide range of plants, fruits and vegetables that all of the children have helped to plant and then look after. The children also help to take responsibility for caring for our many animals that live at Smartie Pants, with collecting the chicken and duck eggs a real highlight for all! Food scraps from the kitchen are collected and fed to the animals by the children, as well as fruit scraps from the Little Geniuses room placed into our communal compost bin and fed to the worms in our worm farm. Our children's involvement in these sustainable practices encourage a sense of responsibility, not just in their learning environment, but for the world they live in. The plants and animals depend on the care provided by the children and would not be able to thrive and prosper without them.</p>

<p>We embrace diversity and community and display an interest in all similarities and differences, equity, fairness and empathy towards everyone. Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are recognised as an important part of our nation’s history and our educators strive to actively include acknowledgement of these cultures on our daily programmed experiences. Our Kindergarten children become involved in a Kinder Buddy Program throughout the year, where our children head down to the Hug-a-Bubs room and interact and create relationships with the babies. This, again, adds to the children's sense of responsibility as they are required to provide care for, nurture and guide smaller versions of themselves through their play.</p>

<p>As kinder educators, we believe that we need to be able to continue to learn. By actively seeking opportunities to continue to progress as educators, we not only build on our knowledge but also pass on more and more learning opportunities to the children. All educators continually participate in professional development opportunities in order to grow as both educators and as learners. We engage many different approaches when educating our children and offer children a variety of ways to learn throughout their time in their learning environment. This way each child’s individual abilities
are addressed.</p>

                        <p>We do this by engaging children in discussion about sustainability and what it means.  Such as recycling, looking after the land, looking after the animals and producing our own food.  We educate the children on energy saving, being responsible for noticing when we don’t need lights on and water saving ideas. Smartie Pants use a worm farm and composting bin to reduce food waste within the service and children for a long time now have been involved in this practice.</p>
                        <p>For the educators, we have developed practices to promote sustainability in many ways.  Smartie Pants has a water tank that is used to water our gardens. Educators also empty water play containers and any left-over water into the gardens. We use solar power and have reduced the amount of chemicals used in the centre through natural products, such as vinegar, tea tree oil, bicarb soda etc. Smartie Pants encourage families and educators to bring in materials they no longer use or need, such as jars, ribbons, fabrics, boxes, bags etc.</p>
                        <p>We have set up displays of sustainability messages that can be easily seen by families. This is an area where parents and educators can leave donations of any kind that are suitable for childcare use.  We also have a sustainability section in our quarterly magazine that informs families on any updates.</p>
                        <p>Smartie pants have regular sustainability meetings where the team come up with new and innovative ideas to continually improve on our sustainability practices.</p>
                        <p>Our centre is very passionate about sustainability – Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much.</p>

                        <p>Educating children on the Indigenous history, culture, and perspectives is essential in reversing the legacy of Australia's excluded past, addressing poor socio-economic outcomes in Indigenous children and supporting reconciliation between Indigenous and non-indigenous Australians (Westaway, 2014; Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, n.d; Craven, 2020). There are many other benefits of teaching Indigenous Australian histories, cultures and perspectives to all young children, including that the future generation respect and understand the importance of the land they live in (Mandewo, n.d.). Children's ongoing development is also supported through historical teaching inquiry and essential empathy skills (Westaway, 2014). During early childhood, children form opinions and understandings that they will carry with them. Thus learning Indigenous history forms lifelong cultural competence and encourages the fulfilment of the human rights of the Indigenous to have their own cultures, histories and perspectives recognised and respected (Mandewo, n.d.). It also fosters stronger connections to the land, a deeper understanding of the natural world and environmental stewardship (Yiramalay/Wesley Studio School, 2019). Children's emotional and social well-being are also supported, understanding their identity, place in the world and different ways that cultures and communities can come together (Early Childhood Australia, 2019; Evolve Communities, 2023)

                        In early 2020, our service created a Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) under the Narragunnawali framework. Two fundamental principles of the National Quality Framework require that equity, inclusion and diversity underpin teaching practice and that Indigenous cultures are valued (Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority, 2022). While initially starting only a tiny project led by one team leader, this project is now fully embedded into all our operations, and our actions are only getting more adventurous.

Prelit is an evidence based learning program designed to integrate into the Multilit which over the last 25 years has been delivered in the Australian School system. PreLit uses  a systematic and skill-based approach to help children develop a strong foundation for reading. It equips early childhood teachers with the necessary resources to teach pre-literacy skills in an enjoyable and interactive manner.

                      <p><a target="new" href="https://soundsgoodtome.com.au/">Animal Fun</a> is a movement program aimed at enhancing the gross and fine motor skills as well as social skills of children aged 3-6 years. The program was created by a team of physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and psychologists affiliated with Curtin University's Health Sciences Faculty.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      To assess the effectiveness of the program, a three-year randomised controlled trial research project was conducted and financially supported by Healthway, the Western Australian Government. The research project sought to determine whether Animal Fun could yield positive outcomes. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Based on the evidence gathered, it was found that children who participated in the Animal Fun Program for a duration of 10 weeks exhibited notable improvements in both their motor skills and social skills. These improvements included advancements in fundamental movement skills like one-legged balance and throwing.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Smartie Pants commenced using Animal Fun in early 2021 and have found that children from all our age groups enjoy the challenging poses that the program inspires. Through simple imitations of certain animals children engage their core, focus on balance, coordinate movement of their gross motor skills and use creativity to imagine and recreate the world they see around them.

                      <p><a target="new" href="https://education.unimelb.edu.au/3a#about">The Abecedarian approach</a> in early childhood education is a comprehensive program that emphasises language development, cognitive skills, and social-emotional growth in young children. This approach is characterised by its focus on individualised instruction, stimulating learning environments, and consistent caregiver interaction. The benefits of the Abecedarian approach are significant. Research has shown that children who receive this type of intervention tend to demonstrate higher cognitive abilities, improved language skills, and enhanced academic performance later in life. Moreover, the program has been found to have a positive impact on social skills, self-regulation, and overall school readiness. The Abecedarian approach plays a vital role in supporting the holistic development of children during their crucial early years, setting a strong foundation for their future success.</p>

                      <p>Auslan (Australian sign language) is the sign language of the Australian Deaf community. It was developed in Australia by people who are deaf so that they could communicate with others. The term Auslan is an acronym of Australian Sign Language, coined by Trevor Johnston in the early 1980s, although the language itself is much older.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      In late 2022 13 of our educators signed up to a <a target="new" href="https://www.lisamillsonline.com/auslan-courses">12 month Auslan language program</a> and have been learning and incorporating Auslan . More recently we have also been incorporating indigenous sign languages into our curriculum, which has been a fantastic way of integrating appreciation for indigenous ways of thinking, learning and communicating into our programs.</p>

                      <p><a target="new" href="https://www.ella.edu.au/">ELLA</a> is a captivating program for young children that offers an engaging digital platform for language learning. It introduces preschoolers to a wide array of cultural experiences from an early age.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Through interactive and playful applications called The Polyglots, children have the opportunity to learn any of thirteen different languages. These apps are specifically designed to be used on tablets within a preschool setting. Their development involved collaboration with experts in language, early childhood education, and technology.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      ELLA offers a range of benefits for preschoolers and educators alike. Firstly, it serves as an effective method for introducing young children to a new language, fostering their interest in language learning both at school and beyond. Additionally, ELLA promotes cultural competency by exposing children to diverse cultures, fostering respect and understanding. It also encourages families to share their home languages, further enhancing language appreciation. Moreover, ELLA plays a significant role in developing children's cognitive and social skills, improving their literacy, memory, and concentration. Lastly, educators who utilise ELLA find themselves growing alongside the children, gaining confidence in incorporating languages and technology into their teaching programs.

                      <p>
                      At Smartie Pants we have chosen Italian as our ELLA language.

                      <p>In 2021 key members of the Smartie Pants commenced the Little Scientist Professional Development program which delivers accredited, <a target="new" href="https://littlescientists.org.au/workshops/">pedagogy-based face-to-face workshops</a> in Water, Air, Engineering, Optics, Acoustics, Mathematics, Human Body, Computer Science, Chemical Reactions and Design and Technologies specifically targeted for early childhood education. We have completed the required training and are currently implementing a number of enquiry learning projects which will be submitted to be assessed and approved as a Little Scientist House. For example, a recent inquiry learning project in our Mini Minors room was sparked by children’s interest in fish in our sustainability garden pond. The children are exploring all sorts of ideas they have about fish, including what they eat, how they breathe and their scales. Our teachers use their questions to spark research which could include reading books, discussions, looking up information online and conducting experiments.</p>
